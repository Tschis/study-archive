# java.util.Collection

---

# Collection

* A collection is an object that represents a group of objects;

* The Collections Framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections;
  * Enables collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details;

* The primary advantages of a collections framework are that it:

  * Reduces programming effort by providing data structures and algorithms so you don't have to write them yourself;
  
  * Provides high-performance implementations of data structures and algorithms;

???

* Because the various implementations of each interface are interchangeable, programs can be tuned by switching implementations;

---

# Collection  
  
* The primary advantages of a collections framework are that it:
  * Provides interoperability between unrelated APIs;
  
  * Reduces the effort required to learn or to design and implement ad hoc APIs;
  
  * Fosters software reuse by providing a standard interface for collections and algorithms with which to manipulate them;

???

* Provides interoperability: by establishing a common language to pass collections back and forth;

* Reduces the effort: by not requiring you to learn and produce your own ad hoc collections APIs;

---

# Collection 

* Many modification methods in the interfaces are labeled optional;
  
* The documentation for each implementation must specify which optional operations are supported;

* Several terms are introduced to aid in this specification:

  * Collections that do not support modification operations are referred to as "unmodifiable", the counterpart being "modifiable";
  
  * Collections that guarantee that no change in the collection object will be visible are referred to as "immutable", the counterpart being "mutable";

???

* Optional: implementations are permitted to not perform one or more of these operations, throwing a runtime exception (UnsupportedOperationException) if they are attempted;

* Modification operations such as add, remove and clear;

---

# Collection 

* Several terms are introduced to aid in this specification:  

  * Lists that guarantee that their size remains constant even though the elements can change are referred to as "fixed-size", the counterpart being "variable-size";
  
  * Lists that support fast (generally constant time) indexed element access are known as "random access lists", the counterpart being "sequential access lists";
      * The RandomAccess marker interface is used by lists to advertise the fact that they support random access;

???

* This enables generic algorithms to change their behavior to provide good performance when applied to either random or sequential access lists;  

---

class: center, middle
# Set

---
# Set

* A collection that contains no duplicate elements and at most one null element;

* All constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements;

* Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain:
  * Some implementations prohibit null elements;
  
  * Some have restrictions on the types of their elements;
  
* Common implementations:
  * HashSet
  * TreeSet
  * LinkedHashSet
  
---

# TreeSet

* Based on a TreeMap;

* Not synchronized;

* Elements are ordered using their natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at set creation time;

* Provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains);

---

# HashSet

* Backed by a HashMap instance;

* Permits the null element;

* Not synchronized;

* Makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set; 
  * In particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time;

* Offers constant time performance for the basic operations: add, remove, contains and size;

---

# LinkedHashSet

* Hash table and linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order;

* Permits the null element;

* Not synchronized;

* Differs from HashSet because it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries, so it maintains insertion-order;

* Provides constant-time performance for the basic operations: add, contains and remove;

---

class: center, middle
# List

---

# List

* An ordered collection (a sequence);

* The user has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted, and can access elements by their index (position), or search for elements in the list;

* Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements, including multiple null elements;

* Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain:
  * Some implementations prohibit null elements;
  
  * Some have restrictions on the types of their elements;

* Common implementations:
  * Vector
  * ArrayList
  * LinkedList
  
---

# Vector

* This class was retrofitted to implement the List interface, making it a member of the Java Collections Framework;

* Is roughly equivalent to ArrayList, except that it is synchronized;
  * If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use ArrayList;

---

# ArrayList

* Implements a growable array of objects;

* Contains elements that can be accessed using an integer index;

* The size can grow as needed to accommodate adding items after the ArrayList has been created;

* Operations size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and listIterator run in constant time;
  * The add operation runs in amortized constant time;
  
  * All of the other operations run in linear time (roughly);	

* Each ArrayList instance has a capacity and, as elements are added, its capacity grows automatically;

???

* The capacity is always at least as large as the list size;

---

# LinkedList

* [Doubly-linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) implementation of the List and Deque interfaces;
  * A set of sequentially linked nodes;
  
  * Each node contains two fields that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence;
  
  * The beginning and ending nodes point to null;

* Not synchronized;

* Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements (including null);

# Queue

---

# Queue

* A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing;

* Provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations;

* Every Queue implementation must specify its ordering properties;
  
* Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO manner;
  * Priority queues order elements according to a supplied comparator, or the elements' natural ordering;
  
  * Stacks are queues ordering the elements in a LIFO manner;
  
* The head of the queue is always that element which would be removed by a call to remove() or poll();

???
  * Each these additional operations exists in two forms: 
    * One throws an exception if the operation fails, designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted Queue implementations;
    
    * The other returns a special value (null or false), for most implementations, where insert operations cannot fail;
  
---

# PriorityQueue

* Does not permit null elements;

* Not synchronized;

* The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering, or by a provided Comparator;

* The head is the least element with respect to the specified ordering;

???

* Head: if multiple elements are tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are broken arbitrarily;

---

# PriorityQueue

* Is unbounded, but has an internal capacity;
  * Capacity is always at least as large as the queue size;
  
  * As elements are added, its capacity grows automatically;

* Provides: 
  * O(log(n)) time for offer, poll, remove and add methods;
  
  * Linear time for the remove(Object) and contains(Object) methods; 
  
  * Constant time for the retrieval methods (peek, element, and size)

---

class: center, middle
# Deque

---

# Deque

* Linear collection that supports insertion and removal at both ends;

* Name is short for "double ended queue", usually pronounced "deck";

* Extends the Queue interface;
  * When a deque is used as a queue, FIFO behavior results;
  
* Deques can also be used as LIFO stacks;
  * Should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class;

* Provides two methods to remove interior elements, removeFirstOccurrence and removeLastOccurrence;

* Does not provide support for indexed access to elements;

* LinkedList is the most popular implementation;

# Comparisons 
## ArrayList vs LinkedList

---

# ArrayList vs LinkedList

* LinkedList implements List with a doubly-linked list:
  * Allows for constant-time insertions or removals using iterators;
   
  * You can walk the list forwards or backwards, but finding an element in the list takes time proportional to its size;

* ArrayList implements List with a dynamically re-sizing array:
  * Allows constant time random read access;
  
  * Adding/removing from anywhere but the end requires shifting all the latter elements over;
  
  * When the capacity of the underlying array is exceeded, a bigger array is allocated;

???

* ArrayList resizing makes add operations O(n) at worst case, but constant on average;

---

# LinkedList Complexities

* get(int index) is O(n) average;

* .green[add(E element) is O(1);]

* add(int index, E element) is O(n) average;
	
* remove(int index) is O(n) average;

* .green[Iterator.remove() is O(1);]

* .green[ListIterator.add(E element) is O(1);]
  
---

# ArrayList Complexities

* .green[get(int index) is O(1);]

* .green[add(E element) is O(1) amortized];
  * O(n) worst-case, while resizing array;
  
* add(int index, E element) is O(n) average;

* remove(int index) is O(n) average;

* Iterator.remove() is O(n) average;

* ListIterator.add(E element) is O(n) average;

# Comparisons 
## HashSet vs TreeSet

---

# HashSet vs TreeSet

* Both implementations are not synchronized;

* Both garantee duplicate-free collections of elements;

* HashSet is faster than TreeSet on basic operations;
  * O(1) for operations like add, remove and contains;

* TreeSet guarantees that elements will be sorted;
  * Ascending natural order, or using a comparator specified via constructor;
  
  * The cost is O(log n) complexity for basic operations like add, remove and contains;

# Map

---

# Map

* Other collection interfaces are based on java.util.Map and are not true collections, i.e., they do not implement the Collection interface;

* However, they contain collection-view operations, which enables them to be manipulated as collections;

* A map is an object that maps keys to values;

* It cannot contain duplicate keys, each key can map to at most one value;

* Provides three collection views, which allow a map's contents to be viewed as:
  * A set of keys;
  * A collection of values;
  * A set of key-value mappings (entries);
  
???

* Some implementations make specific guarantees as to their order, like the TreeMap, and others do not, like the HashMap;
